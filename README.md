## Fuel Rats Gamemode

### Premise

Various vehicles compete across the map to reach a fuel canister. Once a vehicle has a fuel canister they are considered the scrum holder. A scrum holder must deliver their canister to a predetermined gas station. No more than four canisters may exist at one time.

Scrum holders can be robbed by simply bumping your front bumper into the driver side door of the scrum holder. If you are successful you will steal the canister from the scrum holder and become the scrum holder.

At all times the goals for scrum holders will always be set and seen by all players across the map. Players may choose to pursue the scrum holder or simply camp the scrum holderâ€™s destination. It is up to the player to decide how they get the canister to the goal.

Each canister that is successfully delivered will increase the global fuel supply. This will always reward the player who scores the canister with credits.

Players will all have fuel. Fuel can be picked up from any gas station by simply driving through it and having at least 1 credit per 1 unit of fuel they wish to refuel. Fuel will be subtracted from the global supply and added to the individual player. If a player runs out of fuel they will become stranded and all credits they have earned will be completely lost and their current vehicle will be deleted. They will have to start fresh.

Players are not encouraged to form teams but nothing will prevent them from forming a team.
All vehicles will be limited to a standard vehicle speed.

Credits can be spent on randomizing vehicle upgrades in 5 slots. Each slot will give the player an increased maximum speed ranging from 1 to 10 units.

A perfect vehicle will consist of [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]. Resulting in a 50 unit speed increase. These speeds cannot be re-rolled. All vehicle appearances can be purchased for credits but are lost if their vehicle is disabled.
